# webscraper
* simple rvest webscraper that gets content from a website and saves result to csv file
(currently tracks pricelist)
* this bot uses cron job and runs on ubuntu
* needs DESCRIPTION file to run setup-r-dependencies@v2 with extra packages: rvest, dplyr, tidyr
* changed cron to run only once a week
* update: Nov 2022: website changed - script not working any longer - action will be paused until I have time to re-write everything
